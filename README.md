## The motivation

If you are a freelancer or a small startup, and you have in your portfolio an admin dashboard product, trying to promote it and sell it, can be challenging without a serious budget. The first page in Google for the keyword “admin dashboards” is full of well-positioned companies like ColorLib, WrapBootstrap, and other companies at the same level.

<br />

## The plan

To get Google's attention, we need to pass this simple checklist:

- A fast, well-structured website
- Specific content
- No bullshit or spam
- Good referrals  

<br />

## Implementation

- The domain name **admin-dashboards.com**, match 100% the keyword we are targeting. And it was free. This fact forced me to think `God is a hacker`

- **The speed**. I was testing a few static website generators (Hugo, Gridsome, Jekkyl) but the winner was [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/). The result: this app scores more than 90 on Lighthouse and is a clone of this [gatsby starter](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/starters/GatsbyCentral/gatsby-v2-starter-lumen/). There is no login, registration, the entire app is plain HTML, that follows best SEO, and usability practices. You may read [here](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/gatsby-core-philosophy/) about Gatsby.  

- **The website structure**:

  - Categories are keywords related to the `admin dashboard` keyword. The winners (selected by the search volumes) are:
  - `react dashboard` - 2.9k mo searches
  - `vue dashboard` - 1k mo searches
  - `angular dashboards` - 2.9k mo searches
  - `flask dashboard` - 0.7k mo searches
  - Products. Each dashboard will be listed in two places: as an item in the mother category, and as a single page, in the root of the website. See the website files structure bellow, for more information

- **The content**: the information for each product will be curated to provide only relevant information to the audience. 

- **The referrals** The Github repository was created to follow the domain signature. `github.com/admin-dashboards`. Also, the products, with a little bit of traction from the audience, will have a correspondent project on Github, on address `github.com/admin-dashboards/killer-dashboard`. Google loves this kind of s**t, and will rank the project better than others, because the information (keyword, content) is consistent, across multiple domains.

```bash
## Site structure
