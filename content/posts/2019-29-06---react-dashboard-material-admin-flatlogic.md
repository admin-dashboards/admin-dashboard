[React Dashboard Material Admin](https://flatlogic.com/admin-dashboards/react-material-admin) is an admin panel template built 
with [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/) framework, coded entirely in [React](https://reactjs.org/) 
(no jQuery or Bootstrap dependency). 
The design is delivered with a few sample pages: main dashboard page, login, registration, typography and a minimum set of UI elements.

## How to use it

**React Dashboard** Material Admin can be a good source to learn React and basic coding, but in the same time we can use it as 
a [React](https://reactjs.org/) boilerplate for a real **admin dashboard** application, used in production. 

In order to understand the code and use the app, we need at least a basic knowledge about Javascript, [React](https://reactjs.org/) 
and command line tools (yarn, node, npm). 
To build this admin dashboard we need to follow the intructions, provided by the publisher in the [README](https://github.com/flatlogic/react-material-admin/blob/master/README.md) file. In case you want to build the app, without leavind this page, please follow the steps:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/flatlogic/react-material-admin.git
$ cd react-material-admin 
$ yarn 
$ yarn start # live edit
$ yarn build # production build
```

The app is well organized, and the source code is clean and well documented. 
**React Dashboard Material Admin** was successfully built on two environments (x64 Win10, and Ubuntu 18.04) without issues or workarounds.
