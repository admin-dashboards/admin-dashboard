---

Hello audience, 

This article is a curated list with **admin dashboards** coded in [React](https://reactjs.org/) 
released under a permissive license ( [MIT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License), [Apache](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_License) ) 
by the publishers. 
All apps listed on this page are suitable for hobby or commercial projects.

### The Motivation for writing this article

The existing `Top 45+ React Dashboards ..` articles, most of them, are written by the publishers, 
and sometimes they have this habit of sniffing a lot of commercial apps without mention this aspect in the title. 
I'm not saying this is good or bad, but is not obvious if the apps are free or not, just by reading the title. 

Well, this is not the case with this index. All apps listed here are released under the [MIT license](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License), 
and we will mention if the publisher requests the email address or not to deliver the app.


#### Note for newcomers
The goal of this **open-source** service is to promote **admin dashboards** crafted by restless geeks and freelancers, 
to become visible in front of big sharks and jailed markets (e.g. ColorLib, ThemeForest).  

**You may read [here how it works](/how-it-works)**, and the whole idea behind this service.
