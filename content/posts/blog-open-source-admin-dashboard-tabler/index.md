Hello coders,

### Note from the [publisher](https://codecalm.net/)

We created this admin panel for everyone who wants to create any templates based on our pre-made components. Our mission is to deliver a user-friendly,clear and easy administration panel, that can be used by both, simple websites and sophisticated systems. The only requirement is a basic HTML and CSS knowledge—as a reward, you'll be able to manage and visualize different types of data in the easiest possible way!

- **Responsive**: With support for mobile, tablet and desktop it doesn’t matter what device you’re using. Tabler is responsive in all major browsers.
Cross Browser: Our theme works perfectly with Latest Chrome, Firefox+, Latest Safari, Opera, Edge and mobile browsers. We work hard to continuously support them.
- **HTML5 & CSS3**: We only use modern web technologies like HTML5 and CSS3. Our theme includes some subtle CSS3 animations so you will get anyone’s attention.
- **Clean Code**: We strictly followed Bootstrap’s guidelines to make your integration as easy as possible. All code is handwritten and W3C valid.
Demo pages: Tabler features over 20 individual pages featuring various components, giving you the freedom to choose and combine. All components can take variation in color and styling that can easily be modified using Sass. The sky is the limit!

## Setup the environment

To use our build system and run our documentation locally, you'll need a copy of Tabler's source files. Follow these steps:

- Install Node.js, which we use to manage our dependencies.
Navigate to the root /tabler directory and run npm install to install our local dependencies listed in package.json.
- Install Ruby (with DevKit), recommended version is 2.5.5.
- Install Bundler with gem install bundler, and finally run bundle install. This will install all Ruby dependencies, such as Jekyll and plugins.
