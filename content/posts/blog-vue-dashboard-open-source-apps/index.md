Hello audience,  

This article is a curated list of **admin dashboards** coded in [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) 
released under a permissive license ( [MIT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License), [Apache](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_License) ), suitable for hobby or commercial projects.

### The Motivation for writing this article

The existing `Top 10+ Vue Dashboard ..` articles, most of them, are written by the dashboard publishers, 
or affiliates and sometimes they have this habit of sniffing a lot of commercial apps, in the content without mention this aspect in the title.

I'm not saying this is good or bad, but is not obvious if the apps are free or not, just by reading the title. 
**Well, this is not the case here** because all **admin dashboards** listed here are [open-source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source) and free.

#### Note for newcomers
The goal of this **open-source** service is to promote **[admin dashboards](https://appseed.us/admin-dashboards)** crafted by restless geeks and freelancers, to become visible in front of big sharks and jailed markets (e.g. ColorLib, ThemeForest).
**You may read [here how it works](/how-it-works)**, and the whole idea behind this service.
