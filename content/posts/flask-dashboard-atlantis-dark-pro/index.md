## Build from sources

```
$ # clone the sources
$ git clone https://github.com/app-generator/flask-dashboard-atlantis-dark-pro.git

$
$ # install modules using a virtualenv
$ virtualenv --no-site-packages env
$ source env/bin/activate
$
$ # Install modules
$ pip3 install -r requirements-sqlite.txt
$
$ # Start the application (development mode)
$ # --host=0.0.0.0 - expose the app on all network interfaces (default 127.0.0.1)
$ # --port=5000    - specify the app port (default 5000)  
$ flask run --host=0.0.0.0 --port=5000
